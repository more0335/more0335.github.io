        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Born Camila Andrea Moreno Ag√ºero on October 1, 2004 in Lima, Peru, I am a Spring/Summer 2023 <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> student at Algonquin College, delighted to be in her 1<sup>st</sup> semester. Before joining this two-year program, I was part of the Fall 2022 intake of the Drawing Foundations for Illustration and Animation one-year program.</p>

        <p>I like to listen to music, go to the movies, go out with friends and stay connected with my family and friends in Peru through calls. Art is my <em>biggest</em> interest; things related to painting, drawing, sculpting, animation, digital design, photography, videography, literature, music, singing, dancing, and acting catch my eye the most.</p>
